# Group 4 Operation repository
This repository contains everything to run the application.

# Vagrant
Go into the `/operation` directory and run `vagrant up` to start up the application.


# Deploy model
We have decided to not use Vagrant and skip the provisioning part since we could not get it to work. However, it can still be graded and parts of the provisioning and Vagrant are working, like booting up the VM's and using Ansible playbooks. Though installing kubernetes that works across machines was not viable in the time. So to showcase it works in a kubernetes cluster we use Minikube.
